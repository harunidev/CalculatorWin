Calculator Application

This project is a calculator application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. The application performs basic and advanced mathematical operations with a web-based interface. The backend is implemented in Java, and the frontend is enhanced with modern web technologies.

Features

Basic Mathematical Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Functions: Exponential calculations, square root, modulus, and trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan).

Responsive Interface: Modern design created using Bootstrap.

Dynamic Feedback: Animations and instant visual feedback.

Server-side Computation: All calculations are performed on the backend for faster and more secure processing.

Setup and Execution

Requirements

JDK (Java Development Kit) 11 or later.

A web server (Tomcat or Jetty recommended).

A modern web browser.


Project Structure

Backend

Java Servlets: Handle operation requests and responses.

Calculation Service: A dedicated class for performing mathematical operations.

JSON Support: RESTful JSON API used for data communication.

Frontend

HTML and CSS: Static content and basic design.

Bootstrap: For enhancing the user interface.

JavaScript: Dynamic functionality and server interaction.
